# Grade-Reconstruction
Very rough reconstruction of grades from stats given on Canvas


# Plans
I am planning to have this be a refresher on stats

ex. I want to make sure I understand what sort of thing would cause a higher median than mean
    and what that distribution would look like

The starter porblem I will be working on is reconstructing data distributions from canvas
Data Given:
    Number of students eg. samples
    Mean score
    Median score
    Q2
    Q3
    Low score
    High score

look into pyqt graph
